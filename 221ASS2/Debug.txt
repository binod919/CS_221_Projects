First fail was on emptySet_testIsEmpty method. I set the breakpoint on testIsEmpty method and began the debugging.
I found the logical error in isEmpty method in ArraySet.java class and fixed it in order to pass the test.

Second bug I found was in emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty and I set the breakpoint on testIsEmpty method and after 
going through step by stem, I found that rear variable is still 0 even when the setArray contains the element on 
method add() in the ArraySet.java. 

Third bug I found was on A_addB_AB_testRemoveA test. I set the breakpoint on testRemove method. After going through
each step there was logical error on remove method on ArraySet.java causing setArray to go out of bounds.
This bug was fixed by correcting the logic.
